# IDA Pro Detection System

This project provides comprehensive detection capabilities for various aspects of the IDA Pro disassembler. It includes modules for scanning processes, modules, network connections, registry keys, and checking for signatures and old file names. I hope it helps those who are getting started with fighting against debuggers and disassemblers. :D

> **Note**: This tool is extremely overkill and has not been fully tested for false positives. The window title detection may give some false positives, so be careful with that. Everything else has worked reliably in my testing. I wrote this project in a day; it's not the greatest, but it does the job. I recommend using this as inspiration to create your own implementation.
