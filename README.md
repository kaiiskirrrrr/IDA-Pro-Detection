## Getting Started

### Recommendations

These functions either show that IDA pro is installed on the system using many methods, and if its currently running on the system.

### For running IDA: 

- I recommend to wipe the users MBR, or you can blue screen their computer and warn them. Then fully blacklist their computer.

### For installed IDA

- I recommend to warn the user that its against the TOS, give them three warnings, if they open more then three times with IDA wipe their MBR. Then blacklist them
